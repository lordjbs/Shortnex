# Shortnex v3.0
Open Source URL Shortener.
Made with Express and lowdb

# Setup
Basicly, you need NodeJS 9. (8 Works too. Have not tested with other versions, should work tho.)
Do `npm i` for installing all packages.
Delete the conf.json and rename the "conf.EditThisToJSON" to "conf.json" IMPORTANT rename dont use test/tdb.sql & test/users.db use db.db & users.db, the test folder has only test dbs which is not pushed with git.
Than `npm start` and your good to go!

# Executables?
